## II. Overview
This lamda function is triggered by aws-cloudwatch rule periodically at an interval of 5 minutes.

**1.** It creates a new batch every 5 mins.For a new batch IsCurrent attribute is set to true and ReadyForProcessing is set to false.

**2.** Every time it creates new batch it check if a batch exists with IsCurrent as true, then it is set to false and ReadyForProcessing is set to true

### Build and Deploy the Lambda

#### Environment Variables
Below are the environment variable needed :- 

DDB_BATCH_TABLE_ARN - {arn_of_dynamo_db}

LATEST_BATCH_ID  - {latest_batch_id}

SQS_CURATED_BATCHES_QUEUE_ARN - 

#### Build Process

**Step 1**: Setup virtual environment on your system by foloowing below link
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example-deployment-pkg.html#with-s3-example-deployment-pkg-python

**Step 2**: Crete a script file with below contents for e.g(sdc-dot-batch-creation.sh)
```#!/bin/sh

cd {path_to_your_repository}/sdc-dot-batch-creation
zipFileName="{path_to_your_repository}/sdc-dot-batch-creation.zip"

echo "Zip file name is = ${zipFileName}"

zip -9 $zipFileName lambdas/*
zip -r9 $zipFileName common/*
zip -r9 $zipFileName batch_creation_lambda_handler.py

cd {path_to_your_virtual_env}/python3.6/site-packages/
zip -r9 $zipFileName chardet certifi idna
```

**Step 3**: Change the permission of the script file

```
chmod u+x sdc-dot-batch-creation.sh
```

**Step 4** Run the script file
./sdc-dot-batch-creation.sh

**Step 5**: Upload the sdc-dot-metadata-ingest.zip generated from Step 4 to a lambda function via aws console.
